When I’m creating something, it will consume me, and make me forget to eat or go to sleep. When I do create, that is. Whenever I would ignore the itch, I would lose direction and wander for a while, until it eventually came back and became impossible to ignore. Creating something would sedate it, for a while.

## I ignore it, a lot.

## Why do I ignore it?
