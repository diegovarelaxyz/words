Now I don't know when this began, but there came a point in my life where I developed this unquenchable desire to *know* things. When I was about seven, I remember looking out of our car's backseat window, staring up at clouds during a particularly soft golden hour. "How do clouds work?" I ask my mother, who has graciously taken the role of allowing me to filter all questions through her. This is normal behavior for a car ride, in a time before smartphones took off and questions lingered in the air, unanswered.

## The Victory Screen
I started playing video games early on in my life. My grandfather won a Nintendo 64 for us by entering a sweepstakes by mail, and my father was given an Xbox near its release for working on an event. Since then, countless hours have been spent playing, learning about, or discussing games with friends.

In many games, there’s a point early on where your understanding of its mechanics are challenged, and it is from this

~~I’ve played many games with lots to learn, but the one that truly took over that desire I have to learn was a game called League of Legends. League is a complex game, as all MOBAs are. They each have countless system mechanics that you need to know to get started. You need to understand your character: their abilities, how they interact with they game mechanics, how they interact with the other players’ characters, what items you should be buying, when your character is strong in relation to the others in the game, and so much more. Getting one of these wrong in game could very well lead to your defeat, and a slew of less-than-happy messages from your teammates.~~

~~When I started playing the game in as a Sophomore in high school, I picked up on the very basics relatively quickly thanks to my history of playing games. The part I couldn’t skip? Learning the 5+ unique abilities that belonged to each of the ~150 champions. That’s just the introductory knowledge: the real game begins far after acquiring this base if understanding with the game.~~  

~~I’m not quite sure how much time I spent reading, watching videos, and studying professional players’ gameplay, but I can confidently say it was more time than I spent on my high school work.~~

## How Does My Body Work, Actually?

## Clouds and Helicopters
I still don't really know how Helicopters work.
